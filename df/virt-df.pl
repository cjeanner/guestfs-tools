=head1 NAME

virt-df - Display free space on virtual filesystems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-df [--options]

 virt-df [--options] guest [guest ...]

 virt-df [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION






=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=cut

my $help;

=item B<--help>

Display brief help.

=cut

my $uri;

=item B<--connect URI> | B<-c URI>

If using libvirt, connect to the given I<URI>.  If omitted,
then we connect to the default libvirt hypervisor.

Libvirt is only used if you specify a C<domname> on the
command line.  If you specify guest block devices directly,
then libvirt is not used at all.
